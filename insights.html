    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <p>
        Although completing the project was very rewarding, the theory behind the algorithm was
        originally very difficult to understand. After lots of playtesting with the author's
        sample application and looking at some snippets of MATLAB code, we slowly got a better
        understanding of the paper. Although the original problem is complex, the paper shows
        clever methods of approximating a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding the performance, we noticed that the parallel algorithm had more overhead, but
        performed significantly better on Step 1 of the image smoothing algorithm, due to the fact
        that many independent operations can be done at once in parallel with PyCUDA exclusively.
        We also had success with Part 2, although not quite to the same degree, because of the
        Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations. Overall, we were able to achieve significant
        speedups (over 50 times on the largest images). We can see that many problems in computer
        science, especially image processing algorithms, can benefit from parallelization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding the actual implementation, we the difficulties of parallelizing every piece of a
        software. Programming FFT operations from scratch on CUDA seemed outside the scope of our
        knowledge, so we ended up using the premade kernels from the scikits.cuda library. In our
        case, the pre-made functions ended up taking the most time in our parallel implementation,
        thus leaving us with less remaining potential for speedup. Another difficulty regarding the
        FFT was that implementations are different across platforms, such as MATLAB and within python,
        numpy, pyfft, and scikits.cuda. We spent a lot of time configuring the libraries to work
        the way we intended to. 
    </p>
    <h2>Extensions</h2>
    <p>
        The first part we can improve is to parallelize the helper functions that are used in setup of
        both the serial and parallel implementations, mainly computing the OTF. We kept a matrix roll and
        one FFT operation in serial, since the computation time was negligible in comparison to the overall
        run time. While improvements are possible, they would be largely insignificant. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        There are also several usages that are immediately possible with a bit of additional work. As we
        show in our screencast, the presented method of image smoothing is general and can be used for
        many different applications. First, as we showed in the screencast, artifacts from JPEG compression
        can be limited. With addditional work, the smoothed image can also be used to improve edge detection,
        manipulate and boost details, and improve image abstraction. Finally, our implementation can easily
        be extended to work for video, similarly to HW5.
