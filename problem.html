    <h2>Framework</h2>
    <p>
        The paper presents a general global smoothing method based on a sparsity measure, which
        corresponds to the L0-norm of the gradient. A constraint is placed upon the total number
        of non-zero gradients between pixels. The algorithm consists of two main features,
        flattening insignificant details by removing small non-zero gradients, and enhancing
        larger-scale edges, since large gradients are penalized the same amount as small gradients.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, we outline the framework in 1 dimension. We denote the discrete input image as g and
        the smoothed result by f. We create function c(f) for the number of amplitude changes
        between neighboring pixels p and p + 1:
    </p>
    <p>
        <center><img src="img/p1.png"></center>
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, we express our objective function. The c(f) = k signifies that the count of non-zero
        gradients in f is constrained to k. A larger k allows for a finer approximation of the input
        image.
    </p>
    <p>
        <center><img src="img/p2.png"></center>
    </p>
    <p>
        The cost in our objective function is the quadratic intensity difference term, the total
        difference sum between pixels of f and g. The cost term ensures that during smoothing, pixels
        are generally not allowed to have major color changes, meaning diminishing salient edges is
        usually prevented.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, the range of k is dependent on the image, so we modify our cost function to include
        the level of structure flattening as well. The weight lambda controls the weight of c(f). Thus,
        a large lambda results in very few edges. In general, the total number of non-zero gradients is
        inversely proportional to lambda.

    </p>
    <p>
        The framework can easily be extended to 2 dimensions. I is the input image while S is the
        smoothed result. C(S) measures the total L0-norm of the gradients between neighboring pixels:

    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, our objective function in 2D is:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>Approximation</h2>
    <p>
        The closed form solution to the global optimum is NP-hard, but an approximate solution can
        be reduced to minimizing a quadradic function, which is much simpler to solve. We introduce
        2 new auxiliary variables h and v corresponding to the gradients in the x and y direction
        to expand the original terms and update them iteratively. Our new objective function becomes
        the equation on the right. The new term beta controls the similarity between h, v and the
        corresponding gradients. When beta becomes large, our new function appraches the original
        objective on the left.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        We limit the overall number of gradient changes in the image by performing an alternating
        iterative process to approximate our solution, first flattening insignificant details and then
        amplifying prominent edges within each iteration. The goal is to solve the minimization problem
        outlined above.
